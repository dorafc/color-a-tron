## Set up
coming soon

## Features
Color-a-tron is small library with a silly name that generates 5 colors palattes from a single HSL color. The library can also convert HSL colors to rgb hex values for use in front-end code.

## Background
I created this library to generate random color palettes for various personal projects. I also wanted a space to play around with using coding color relationships
